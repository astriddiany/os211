1. [Linux Library](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)<br>
A library is a collection of pre-compiled pieces of code called functions. The library contains common functions and together, they form a package called a library. 

2. [malloc(), calloc(), free() and realloc() ??}](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)<br>
Since C is a structured language, it has some fixed rules for programming. One of it includes changing the size of an array. An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.

3. [Uses of Hexadecimal](https://teachcomputerscience.com/uses-of-hexadecimal/)<br>
Hexadecimal numbering system is often used by programmers to simplify the binary numbering system.  Computers use binary numbering system while humans use hexadecimal numbering system to shorten binary and make it easier to understand.

4. [Partition Allocation Methods in Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-allocation-methods-in-memory-management/)<br>
Most of the operating systems (for example Windows and Linux) use Segmentation with Paging. A process is divided into segments and individual segments have pages. 

5. [Non-Contiguous Allocation in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/non-contiguous-allocation-in-operating-system/)<br>
In non-contiguous allocation, Operating system needs to maintain the table which is called Page Table for each process which contains the base address of the each block which is acquired by the process in memory space. In non-contiguous memory allocation, different parts of a process is allocated different places in Main Memory.

6. [Virtual Memory Address Translation](https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/os/address-translation.xhtml)<br>
In a system with virtual memory the main memory can be viewed as a cache for the disk, which serves as the lower-level store. Due to the enormous difference between memory access times and disk access times, a fully-associative caching scheme is used.

7. [Dynamic Linking vs. Dynamic Loading](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/dynamic-linking-vs-dynamic-loading)<br>
Linking and loading are two instruments that play a pivotal role in program execution. Linking intends to generate an executable module of a program by combining the object codes generated by the assembler. A loader, on the other hand, loads these executable modules to the main memory for execution.

8. [Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) in Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb-in-paging/)<br>
In Operating System, for each process page table will be created, which will contain Page Table Entry (PTE). This PTE will contain information like frame number (The address of main memory where we want to refer), and some other useful bits (e.g., valid/invalid bit, dirty bit, protection bit etc). 

9. [Pointers in C Explained – They're Not as Difficult as You Think](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pointers-in-c-are-not-as-difficult-as-you-think/)<br>
Pointers are arguably the most difficult feature of C to understand. But, they are one of the features which make C an excellent language. This article will explains it from the very basics of pointers to their usage with arrays, functions, and structure.

10. [Pointers vs References in C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-vs-references-cpp/)<br>
On the surface, both references and pointers are very similar, both are used to have one variable provide access to another. With both providing lots of the same capabilities, it’s often unclear what is different between these different mechanisms. This article will illustrate the differences between pointers and references.
