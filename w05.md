1. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual memory is a memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the main memory. Virtual memory is a very common technique used in the operating systems (OS) of computers.

2. [Differences between Cache Memory and Virtual Memory](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/differences-between-cache-memory-and-virtual-memory.aspx#:~:text=The%20term%20%22virtual%20memory%22%20refers,enlarges%20the%20volume%20of%20RAM.)<br>
In memory hierarchy, there is an additional level of memory which is Cache. It is high-speed storage and much faster than the main storage. It is much expensive as compared to main storage. So, a relatively small amount of cache is used.

3. [What is non-uniform memory access in industrial controls?](https://www.motioncontroltips.com/what-is-non-uniform-memory-access-in-industrial-controls/)<br>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a kind of memory architecture that allows a processor faster access to contents of memory than other traditional techniques. In other words, in a NUMA architecture, a processor can access local memory much faster than non-local memory.

4. [Thrashing and Working Sets](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-winter12/lecture.php?topic=thrashing)<br>
How to deal with thrashing? If a single process is too large for memory, there is nothing the OS can do. That process will simply thrash. If the problem arises because of the sum of several processes:
* Figure out how much memory each process needs.
* Change scheduling priorities to run processes in groups that fit comfortably in memory: must shed load.

5. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm)<br>
In a computer operating system that uses paging for virtual memory management, page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory (page fault) and a free page cannot be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.

6. [Virtual Address Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space)<br>
In computing, a virtual address space (VAS) or address space is the set of ranges of virtual addresses that an operating system makes available to a process. The range of virtual addresses usually starts at a low address and can extend to the highest address allowed by the computer's instruction set architecture and supported by the operating system's pointer size implementation, which can be 4 bytes for 32-bit or 8 bytes for 64-bit OS versions.

7. [Copy-on-Write Semantics](https://medium.com/@arpitbhayani/copy-on-write-semantics-9538bbeb9f86)<br>
Copy-On-Write, abbreviately referred to as CoW suggests deferring the copy process until the first modification. A resource is usually copied when we do not want the changes made in either to be visible to the other.

8. [Will ‘Htop’ Replace Default ‘Top’ Monitoring Tool in Linux?](https://www.tecmint.com/htop-vs-top-in-linux/)<br>
Top is a traditional command-line tool for monitoring real-time processes in a Unix/Linux systems, it’s comes preinstalled on most if not all Linux distributions and shows a useful summary of system information including uptime, total number of processes (and number of: running, sleeping, stopped and zombie processes), CPU and RAM usage, and a list of processes or threads currently being managed by the kernel.

9 [What Is Kernel Memory in Task Manager?](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-kernel-memory-in-task-manager)<br>
The kernel memory in the task manager is a part of the total memory available in a computer that is blocked off for the operating system's processes. The total memory consists of the RAM (random-access memory) and the virtual memory.

10 [Memory-mapped IO vs Port-mapped IO](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Embedded/memory_mapped_io_vs_port_mapped_isolated_io.php)<br>
Microprocessors normally use two methods to connect external devices: memory mapped or port mapped I/O. However, as far as the peripheral is concerned, both methods are really identical.
