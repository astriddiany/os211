1. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing.

2. [Interrupts 101](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/interrupts)<br>
An interrupt is a signal which is sent from a device or from software to the operating system. The interrupt signal causes the operating system to temporarily stop what it is doing and ‘service’ the interrupt. The interrupt handler is the part of the operating system which is responsible for dealing with interrupt signals. The interrupt handler prioritises interruptions as they are received, placing them into a queue as necessary. For every interruption, the current task needs to be stopped, with it’s status saved (so it can resume later).

3. [How to Achieve Concurrency?](https://medium.com/swift-india/concurrency-parallelism-threads-processes-async-and-sync-related-39fd951bc61d)<br>
Consider you are given two tasks of cooking and speaking to your friend over the phone. You could do these two things simultaneously. You could cook as well as speak over the phone. Now you are doing your tasks parallelly. Parallelism means performing two or more tasks simultaneously. Parallel computing in computer science refers to the process of performing multiple calculations simultaneously.

4. [Difference between Long-Term and Short-Term Scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-long-term-and-short-term-scheduler/)<br>
Long-Term Scheduler is also known as Job Scheduler. Long-term scheduler regulates the programs which are selected to system for processing. In this the programs are setup in the queue and as per the requirement the best one job is selected and it takes the processes from job pool. It regulates the Degree of Multi-programming (DOM).

Short-Term Scheduler is also known as CPU Scheduler. Short-Term Scheduler ensures which program is suitable or important for processing. It regulates the less DOM (Degree of Multi-programming).

5. [Difference between Process and Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)<br>
Process: Process means any program is in execution. Process control block controls the operation of any process. Process control block contains information about processes for example Process priority, process id, process state, CPU, register, etc. A process can creates other processes which are known as Child Processes. Process takes more time to terminate and it is isolated means it does not share memory with any other process.

Thread: Thread is the segment of a process means a process can have multiple threads and these multiple threads are contained within a process. A thread have 3 states: running, ready, and blocked. Thread takes less time to terminate as compared to process and like process threads do not isolate.

6. [Difference between User Level and Kernel Level Thread in Tabular Form](https://alldifferences.net/difference-between-user-level-and-kernel-level-thread/)<br>
The Major Difference between User Level and Kernel Level Thread is that User Level Threads is managed by the User. Kernel Level Threads managed by Operating System. All modern operating systems support the threading model. Implementation of a thread will change according to the operating system.

7. [Challanges in Programming for Multicore System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/challanges-in-programming-for-multicore-system/)<br>
Multicore System consists of two or more processors which have been attached to a single chip to enhance performance, reduce power consumption, and more efficient simultaneous processing of multiple tasks. Multicore system has been in recent trend where each core appears as a separate processor. Multicore system is capable of executing executing more than one threads parallely whereas in Single core system only one thread can execute at a time.

8. [Is Concurrency Really Increase the Performance?](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-concurrency-really-increases-the-performance-8cd06dd762f6)<br>
If you want to increase the performance of your program one possible solution is to add concurrent programming techniques. Basically, in concurrent execution, multiple threads of the same program executes at the same time. It is similar to adding more workers to complete a job.

The Linux terminal has a number of useful commands that can display running processes, kill them, and change their priority level. This post lists the classic, traditional commands, as well as some more useful, modern ones.

10. [What Is sleep() function and How To Use It In C Program?](https://www.poftut.com/what-is-sleep-function-and-how-to-use-it-in-c-program/)<br>
C programming language provides sleep() function in order to wait for a current thread for a specified time. slepp() function will sleep given thread specified time for the current executable.
